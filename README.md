This is a simple file created with EvoThings to detect BTLE Beacons and send xAPI statements.

Statements will be sent:
    When an identified beacon is found
    When an identified beacon is lost

This is an early version and the LRS is defined in the ./js/xapiwrapper.js file because I was too lazy to do it correctly.


I will add more comments as I can.
